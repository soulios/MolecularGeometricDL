# MolecularGeometricDL
A repo of the most seminal applications of geometric deep learning in molecular tasks.

The most comprehensive professionally curated resource on Geometric Deep learning applied in molecular tasks including the best tutorials, videos, books, papers, articles, courses, websites, conferences and open-source libraries.
I am creating this resource, while conducting my PhD work at Helmholtz Centre of Environmental Research under the supervision of Dr. Jana Schor.
The papers will be listed by time order, noting the advancements along the way.
